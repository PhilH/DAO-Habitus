# Structured Decision-Making Framework

Is only needed when there is lack of clarity about a decision that is _higher risk_. Higher risk can mean that the decision has long term implications or that it can be costly to unwind if the wrong decision is made.[\*]()

[A framework that offers structure]() to the ambiguous and high-risk decisions. Structure removes ambiguity around process and should lead to better decisions with lower overhead. The framework has three stages: **\(1\)** setting the parameters, **\(2\)** deliberation, and **\(3\)** decision.

* **Setting the parameters** is about describing what decision weâ€™re making, who needs to make the decision, who is impacted, and when the decision needs to be made. [Proposal building]()
* **Deliberation** is voting on the options. [Loomio]()
* **Decision** documents the decision made, the rationale for the decision, and the plan to communicate the decision back to those impacted. _You are here_, this is literaly what this proposal is about.

If the decision is both ambiguous and high-stakes, we use the framework. If the decision is only ambiguous, the decision-maker can collaborate with a few people and make the call. And if the decision is neither ambiguous or high-stakes, the decision-maker should simply move forward. In all cases, communication to the team completes the decision.
