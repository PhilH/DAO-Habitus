# Decision-Making

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

{% page-ref page="simple-decision-making-process.md" %}

Prioritizes execution over deliberation. Empowering a team to execute comes with the risk of making more mistakes.

{% page-ref page="structured-decision-making-framework.md" %}

Is only needed when there is lack of clarity about a decision that is _higher risk_. Higher risk can mean that the decision has long term implications or that it can be costly to unwind if the wrong decision is made.[\*]()

{% hint style="info" %}
If the decision is both ambiguous and high-stakes, we use the **framework**. If the decision is only ambiguous, the decision-maker can **collaborate** with a few people and make the call. And if the decision is neither ambiguous or high-stakes, the decision-maker should simply **move forward**. In all cases, **communication** to the team completes the decision.
{% endhint %}

### **Communication is critical to the process.**

> A decision is not complete until all impacted by that decision are notified. if you'd never abandon a puppy, why abandon decisions outputs? Think about the puppies.

The decision-maker is accountable for determining the best format to deliver this communication. For example, if everybody is highly impacted, an email to all employees may be the best way to communicate the decision. If nobody is directly impacted today, an FYI in a slack channel and a note in a design doc may be sufficient.

#### Decisions outputs

_What are they and where do they go after decisions have been made?_

Documentation, Logs, notifications to impacted parties. Well, from now on, we should house them here in this neat piece of the cyberspace.
