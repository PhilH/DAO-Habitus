# DAO Habitus

## Proposal: DAO Habitus - Git Based Governance

Governance is messy, Git is neat. So lets use it for that!

**Why?** See _"Why Git?"_ below. 

**What?** 2 Git repositories \(1 public, 1 unlisted\) with all validated documentation, blank files for those yet to come + a kanban, somehow. 

**How?** Honestly I have no clue.

## Governance

> “\[If we consider governance:\] the process by which we attempt to establish \(and maintain/revoke\) the legitimacy of decisions, decision making processes, and related governance norms/expectations,”

We can conceive of many ways to establish the legitimacy of decisions. In some contexts, voting can play a critical role. In others, it’s not needed.[\*](https://www.tonysheng.com/voting-governance)

### Decisions

> “Ultimately, a company’s value is just the sum of the decisions it makes and executes.”

#### **Simple decision-making process**

Prioritizes execution over deliberation. Empowering a team to execute comes with the risk of making more mistakes.

* First, we shall stabilish a [**simple decision-making process**](decision-making/git-based-governance.md). 
* From which we [**engineer the memes**](decision-making/git-based-governance.md) for a culture where the team does not second guess such decisions. 
* And underlying it all, we nurture a shared sense of [**values**](decision-making/git-based-governance.md) that guide decisions. 

May this process provide guidance on how avoid unnecessary costs in low-stakes decisions and prioritize execution on all decisions.

#### **Structured decision-making framework**

Is only needed when there is lack of clarity about a decision that is _higher risk_. Higher risk can mean that the decision has long term implications or that it can be costly to unwind if the wrong decision is made.[\*](decision-making/git-based-governance.md)

[A framework that offers structure](decision-making/git-based-governance.md) to the ambiguous and high-risk decisions. Structure removes ambiguity around process and should lead to better decisions with lower overhead. The framework has three stages: **\(1\)** setting the parameters, **\(2\)** deliberation, and **\(3\)** decision.

* **Setting the parameters** is about describing what decision we’re making, who needs to make the decision, who is impacted, and when the decision needs to be made. [Proposal building](decision-making/git-based-governance.md)
* **Deliberation** is voting on the options. [Loomio](decision-making/git-based-governance.md)
* **Decision** documents the decision made, the rationale for the decision, and the plan to communicate the decision back to those impacted. _You are here_, this is literaly what this proposal is about.

If the decision is both ambiguous and high-stakes, we use the framework. If the decision is only ambiguous, the decision-maker can collaborate with a few people and make the call. And if the decision is neither ambiguous or high-stakes, the decision-maker should simply move forward. In all cases, communication to the team completes the decision.

### **Communication is critical to the process.**

> A decision is not complete until all impacted by that decision are notified. if you'd never abandon a puppy, why abandon decisions outputs? Think about the puppies.

The decision-maker is accountable for determining the best format to deliver this communication. For example, if everybody is highly impacted, an email to all employees may be the best way to communicate the decision. If nobody is directly impacted today, an FYI in a slack channel and a note in a design doc may be sufficient.

#### Decisions outputs

_What are they and where do they go after decisions have been made?_

Documentation, Logs, notifications to impacted parties. Well, from now on, we should house them here in this neat piece of the cyberspace. 

## Why Git

#### Lets design our governance around Git's main traits:

* Distributed
* Collaboration driven
* Community oriented
* Safe environment to work in
* Fast and Agile
