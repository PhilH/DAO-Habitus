# DAO Habitus

## Proposal: DAO Habitus - Git Based Governance

Governance is messy, Git is neat. So lets use it for that!

**Why?** See _"_[_Why Git?_](https://parrachia.gitbook.io/dao-habitus/#why-git)_"_ below. 

**What?** 2 Git repositories \(1 public, 1 unlisted\) with all validated documentation, blank files for those yet to come + a kanban, somehow. 

**How?** Honestly I have no clue.

## Governance

> “\[If we consider governance:\] the process by which we attempt to establish \(and maintain/revoke\) the legitimacy of decisions, decision making processes, and related governance norms/expectations,”

We can conceive of many ways to establish the legitimacy of decisions. In some contexts, voting can play a critical role. In others, it’s not needed.[\*](https://www.tonysheng.com/voting-governance)

## What making decisions look like?

#### DAO Habitus is about designing our governance around Git's main traits:

* Distributed
* Collaboration driven
* Community oriented
* Safe environment to work in
* Fast and Agile
