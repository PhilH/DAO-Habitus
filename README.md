# DAO Habitus

## Proposal: DAO Habitus - Git Based Governance

Governance is messy, Git is neat. So lets use it for that!

**Why?** See _"_[_Why Git_](https://parrachia.gitbook.io/dao-habitus/#why-git)_"_ below. 

**What?** 2 Gitbook spaces, 1 unlisted with all the messy but stable stuff; 1 public with polished and up-to-date documentation + a kanban, somehow. 

**How?** Honestly I have no clue.

## Governance

> “\[If we consider governance:\] the process by which we attempt to establish \(and maintain/revoke\) the legitimacy of decisions, decision making processes, and related governance norms/expectations,”

We can conceive of many ways to establish the legitimacy of decisions. In some contexts, voting can play a critical role. In others, it’s not needed.[\*](https://www.tonysheng.com/voting-governance)

## What making decisions look like?

## And who are we?

## Why Git

#### DAO Habitus is about designing our governance around Git's main traits:

* Distributed
* Collaboration driven
* Community oriented
* Safe environment to work in
* Fast and Agile

## Habitus

> Habitus is ‘the way society becomes deposited in persons in the form of lasting dispositions, or trained capacities and structured propensities to think, feel and act in determinant ways, which then guide them’

Bourdieu sees power as culturally and symbolically created, and constantly re-legitimised through an interplay of agency and structure. The main way this happens is through what he calls ‘habitus’ or socialised norms or tendencies that guide behaviour and thinking.   
_\(Wacquant 2005: 316, cited in Navarro 2006: 16\)._
