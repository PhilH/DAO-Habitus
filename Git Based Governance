# Proposal: Git Based Governance
Governance is messy, Git is neat. So lets use it for that! 

**Why?** See *"Why Git?"* below.
**What?** 2 Git repositories with all validated documentation, blank files for those yet to come + a kanban, somehow.
**How?** Honestly I have no clue.

We can conceive of many ways to establish the legitimacy of decisions.
In some contexts, voting can play a critical role. In others, it’s not needed.[*](https://www.tonysheng.com/voting-governance)

### Decisions
> “Ultimately, a company’s value is just the sum of the decisions it makes and executes.”

##### Simple decision-making process
Prioritizes execution over deliberation. Empowering a team to execute comes with the risk of making more mistakes.

* First, we shall stabilish a **[simple decision-making process](#)**. 
* From which we [engineer the memes](#) for a culture where the team does not second guess such decisions. 
* And underlying it all, we nurture a shared sense of [values](#) that guide decisions. 
 
May this process provide guidance on how avoid unnecessary costs in low-stakes decisions and prioritize execution on all decisions.
##### Structured decision-making framework
Is only needed when there is lack of clarity about a decision that is *higher risk*. Higher risk can mean that the decision has long term implications or that it can be costly to unwind if the wrong decision is made.[*](#)

A [framework](#) offers structure to the ambiguous and high-risk decisions. Structure removes ambiguity around process and should lead to better decisions with lower overhead. The framework has three stages: **(1)** setting the parameters, **(2)** deliberation, and **(3)** decision.

* **Setting the parameters** is about describing what decision we’re making, who needs to make the decision, who is impacted, and when the decision needs to be made. - [proposal building](#)
* **Deliberation** is voting on the options. [Loomio](#)
* **Decision** documents the decision made, the rationale for the decision, and the plan to communicate the decision back to those impacted. *You are here*, this is literaly what this proposal is about.

##### Communication is critical to the process. 
*A decision is not complete until all impacted by that decision are notified*. The decision-maker is accountable for determining the best format to deliver this communication. For example, if everybody is highly impacted, an email to all employees may be the best way to communicate the decision. If nobody is directly impacted today, an FYI in a slack channel and a note in a design doc may be sufficient.

And that leads us to:

#### Decisions outputs
What are they and where do they go after decisions have been made?

Well, from now on, we should house them here in this neat piece of the cyberspace. A repository that can eas
