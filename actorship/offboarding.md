# Offboarding

{% hint style="info" %}
WORK IN PROGRESS
{% endhint %}

## Conditions

The moment a state or quality associated with being an actor of our ecosystem ceases to exist, offboarding may be considered. Albeit those states and qualities might fall in dynamic definitions, some very basic, critical points are listed in the [Actorship page](./).

The actual [Offboarding Ritual](offboarding.md) should look just like a [Onboarding Ritual](onboarding/):

* Informal temperature check
* Application 
* Approval 
* Consolidation

### Triggers for automatic offboarding

* Liveness
  * 1 month without participation on actionables 
  * 2 weeks unjustified inactivity 
* [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)
  * 3 breaches of any kind
  * 1 critical breach
* Accountability
  * Critical non delivery 
  * Conflict of interest
* MESH
  * Complain about too many memes
