# Offboarding

{% hint style="info" %}
WORK IN PROGRESS

## Conditions

The moment a state or quality associated with being an actor of our ecosystem ceases to exist, offboarding may be considered. Albeit those states and qualities might fall in dynamic definitions, some very basic, critical points are listed in the [Actorship page](./).

The actual [Offboarding Ritual](offboarding.md) should look just like a [Onboarding Ritual](onboarding/):

* Informal temperature check
* Application 
* Approval 
* Consolidation

### Triggers for automatic offboarding

* Liveness
  * 1 month without participation on actionables 
  * 2 weeks unjustified inactivity 
* [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)
  * 3 breaches of any kind
  * 1 critical breach
* Accountability
  * Critical non delivery 
  * Conflict of interest
* MESH
  * Complain about too many memes

### Human check

* Administrative circle receives a complaint/ application for offboarding OR notices a liveness/ accountability lapse
  * Through internal mechanisms, circle operatives discuss best course of action
   * If they determine that offboarding is in order, circle lead informs offboarded party
   * If they determine offboarding is the wrong choice, they take no action
   * In either case, they log a record of their decision-making process

### Aftermath of an offboarding

* Administrative circle oversees the redistribution of any crucial roles the offboarded member had been responsible for
