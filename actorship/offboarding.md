## Conditions

The moment a state or quality associated with being an actor of our ecosystem ceases to exist, offboarding may be considered. Albeit those states and qualities might fall in dynamic definitions, some very basic, critical points are listed in the [Actorship page](./).

### Triggers for automatic offboarding

* Liveness
  * 1 month without participation on actionables 
  * 2 weeks unjustified inactivity 
* [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md)
  * 3 breaches of any kind
  * 1 critical breach
* Accountability
  * Critical non delivery 
* MESH
  * Complain about too many memes
