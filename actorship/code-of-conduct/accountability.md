# Accountability

Accountability questions are useful if you have:

* A list of roles that describe the work your team does
* A well-defined purpose and set of accountabilities for each role
* One person to be accountable to each role
* A time to meet regularly to ask each other your accountability questions

The point of accountability questions is to help a team to maintain the practice of self-management, after all the glamorous and fun work around role definition has subsided. It’s our solution to a hard problem: _how do you maintain energy and direction around self-management, once you’ve kick started things with a role definition workshop?_

## Soft Accountability

Some gotta know what's going on and be able \(and available\) to report/share/signal when necessary.

## Hard Accountability

* Role title: **Solution specialist**
* Role purpose: **Take known client problems and generate valuable solutions**
* Role accountabilities: **\* Understand when a client problem is fully defined and ready to be solved \* Help solution brainstorms to be creative  \* Prioritise different solution options \* Form and check hypotheses to validate work that we’re doing \* implement solutions**
