# Actorship

{% hint style="info" %}
I took the liberty to name our "ecosystem participants" as ~actors~ because not everybody is truly an agent \(i.e. posses agency\), there is performance included, and in the agnostic place we're carving for ourselves there is a pretty good chunk of acting - according to each project's "grammars"...   
So what defines a "member" is their "actorship".
